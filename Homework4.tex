\question{A2.2}{Prove Lagrange's theorem: if $H$ is a subgroup of a finite group $G$, then the order of $H$ divides the order of $G$.
}

Let $m=|H|$, so that $H = \{h_1, h_2, \ldots, h_m\}$.

Choose $g_1 \in G \setminus H$, and define $G_1 = \{g_1h_1, g_1h_2, \ldots, g_1h_m\}$.
Then $|G_1| = m$. Also, $G_1 \cap H = \emptyset$, for if $g_1h_i = h_j$ for some $i$ and $j$, then $h_jh_i^{-1}= g_1 \in H$.

If $G\setminus G_1$ is not empty, choose $g_2 \in G\setminus G_1 \setminus H$ and define $G_2$ again as above.

Continue this process until $G \setminus (G_1 \cup G_2 \cup G_3 \cup \ldots \cup G_k) = H$, and there are no more elements to choose.
Then $G = G_1 \cup G_2 \cup \ldots \cup G_k \cup H$, and $|G| = |G_1| + |G_2| + \ldots + |G_k| + m = (k+1)m = (k+1)|H|$.

\question{A2.16}{$S_3$ is the group of permutations of three elements.
Support we order these as mapping 123 to 123; 231; 312; 213; 132, and 321, respectively.
Show that there exist two one-dimensional irreducible representations of $S_3$, one of which is trivial,
and the other of which is 1, 1, 1, -1, -1, -1, corresponding in order to the six permutations given earlier.
Also show that there exists a two-dimensional irreducible representation, with the matrices
\begin{align*}
\begin{pmatrix}
    1 & 0 \\
    0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}, &&
\frac{1}{2}
\begin{pmatrix}
    -1 & -\sqrt{3} \\
    \sqrt{3} & -1
\end{pmatrix}, &&
\frac{1}{2}
\begin{pmatrix}
    -1 & \sqrt{3} \\
    -\sqrt{3} & -1
\end{pmatrix}, \\
\begin{pmatrix}
    -1 & 0 \\
    0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}, &&
\frac{1}{2}
\begin{pmatrix}
    1 & \sqrt{3} \\
    \sqrt{3} & -1
\end{pmatrix}, &&
\frac{1}{2}
\begin{pmatrix}
    1 & -\sqrt{3} \\
    -\sqrt{3} & -1
\end{pmatrix}.
\end{align*}
Verify that the representations are orthogonal.

\question{10.48}{Show that the operations
\begin{align*}
    \overline{Z} & = X_1X_2X_3X_4X_5X_6X_7X_8X_9 \\
    \text{and}\quad \overline{X} & = Z_1Z_2Z_3Z_4Z_5Z_6Z_7Z_8Z_9

act as logical $Z$ and $X$ operators
on a Shor-coded qubit.
That is, show that this $\overline{Z}$ is independent of and commutes with the generators of the Shor code,
and that $\overline{X}$ is independent of and commutes with the generators of the Shor code,
and anti-commutes with $\overline{Z}$.}
